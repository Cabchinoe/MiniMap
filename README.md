MiniMap(Forked from MapWriter)
=========

Now You Can See Teammates!


 A minimap mod for Minecraft


Instructions for development:

1) Run "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace" in the mapwriter folder.

2) Run "gradlew eclipse" if using the eclipse IDE. If it does not work you may
   need to copy the eclipse folder from a Forge src release into the mapwriter
   folder and retry the command.

3) Open eclipse and set the workspace directory to mapwriter/eclipse.

4) You should now be able to modify the code and test by using the "Client" Run
   Configuration.
